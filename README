# NBO Agent - Next Best Offer Generator

## Overview

The **NBO Agent** (Next Best Offer Agent) is a machine learning system that generates **personalized credit offers** for clients based on their profile. Using a **T5-small transformer model**, it can produce natural-language messages tailored to individual clients, taking into account features such as RFM score, risk score, age, gender, income, and number of active loans.

The agent can:

- Automatically generate offers from a CSV of client profiles (`actual_clients.csv`)
- Allow manual input of new client data via console
- Be retrained with updated datasets if needed

The project comes **pretrained on the provided `train_data.csv` and `train_data2.csv`** so it is ready to use immediately.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── train.py                # Fine-tune or retrain the T5 model
├── generate.py             # Generate offers for clients
├── data/                   # CSV datasets
│   ├── train_data.csv

├── nbo_model/              # Pretrained model weights and tokenizer
└── environment.yml         # Conda environment file
```

---

## Setup & Installation

### 1. Create and activate the Conda environment

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml --name nbo_agent
conda activate nbo_agent
```

> The environment includes all necessary Python packages: PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, Datasets, Pandas, etc.

### 2. Update dependencies (optional)

If you install new packages and want to **save them back to `environment.yml`**:

```bash
conda env export --name nbo_agent > environment.yml
```

This ensures reproducibility for future users.

---

## Using the Pretrained Agent

### 1. Generate offers from `actual_clients.csv`

```bash
python generate.py
```

- Reads all clients from `data/actual_clients.csv`
- Generates and prints personalized offers for each client

### 2. Add a new client manually

While running `generate.py`, the script will prompt:

```
Do you want to add a new client manually? (y/n):
```

- Enter `y` to provide client data in the format:

```
rfm,risk,age,gender(M/F),name,income,active_loans
```

Example:

```
57,486,68,F,Karen Taylor,8372,0
```

- The agent will generate a personalized offer immediately.

### 3. Add a new client to `actual_clients.csv`

- Simply append the client row to the CSV file in the same format.
- Run `generate.py` again to read the updated CSV and generate offers.

## Retraining the Agent (Optional)

If you want to **retrain the model** on updated data:

1. Create a new CSV with required columns in `data/` and change the CSV_FILE name. Required columns:

```
rfm,risk,age,gender,name,income,active_loans,offer_text
```

2. Change the name of the saved agent from nbo_model1 to nbo_model2 or any different name to avoid training the model for a lot of time and throwing an error at the end that cannot save it in the same file due to locked folder.

3. Run:

```bash
python train.py
```

- This fine-tunes the T5 model on your dataset.
- Training arguments like number of epochs and batch size can be adjusted in `train.py`.

3. After training, the model and tokenizer are automatically saved to `./nbo_model/`.

> **Note:** The model comes pretrained with `train_data.csv` and `train_data2.csv` for immediate use.

## Example Use Case

**CSV input (`actual_clients.csv`):**

```
rfm,risk,age,gender,name,income,active_loans
45,512,34,F,Anna Petrova,4820,1
72,310,58,M,Georgi Ivanov,7321,2
```

**Generated output:**

```
Client 1: Dear Ms. Petrova, based on your profile we are pleased to extend an exclusive offer...
Client 2: Dear Mr. Ivanov, after reviewing your profile, we regret to inform you that we cannot extend a new credit offer at this time...
```

## Notes on the Machine Learning Model

- The agent uses **T5-small**, a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model.
- It is trained to map a structured customer profile (`rfm`, `risk`, `age`, `gender`, `income`, `active_loans`) to a natural language offer (`offer_text`).
- Pretraining on `train_data.csv` and `train_data2.csv` allows immediate offer generation.
- Retraining updates the model for new clients or custom scenarios.

---

The training data for the model follows these rules:

### 1. RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)

- **High RFM** → loyal and stable client → higher credit amount.
- **Low RFM** → smaller credit amount or shorter term to encourage repayment.

### 2. Risk Score

- **Low risk** → increases maximum credit amount.
- **High risk** (≥700–800) → significantly reduce offer or reject.

### 3. Income

- **High income** → allows higher credit sum.
- **Low income** → limits the offered amount.

### 4. Age

- **18–25 or >65** → reduce credit sum (higher risk).
- **25–30 or 60–65** → medium sums.
- **Other ages** → higher sums.

### 5. Active Loans

- **No active loans** → can offer higher credit.
- **Existing loans** → consider remaining balance before offering new credit.

### 6. Text Personalization

- **Gender-based greeting**:
  - `M` → Dear Mr. `<LastName>`
  - `F` → Dear Ms. `<LastName>`
- **Credit type**:
  - **Installment loan** → high income, few active loans.
  - **Revolving credit** → more active loans or small sum.
- **Decline** → very high risk or too many active loans.
